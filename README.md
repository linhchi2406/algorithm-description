# Disclaimer
This was a forked project from chriszq's Project you can find [HERE](https://github.com/chriszq/VisualSortingAlgorithms "chriszq's Project"). **Visit his/her work first and honor the effort** :)

At one point I decided that I changed to much to be still equivalent to chriszq's application and also the fact he/she has been absent for months.

# Visual Sorting Algorithms
![Start Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelHolley/SortingAlgorithmVisualization/master/PreviewGif/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer_Start.gif "Start")

Sorting algoritms animated using JavaFX. The actual sorting speed is not necessarily correlated with how long it takes to animate the algorithm, for example sometimes it could show numbers being swapped one by one or it could show a group of numbers moving simultaneously.

## Available algorithms
- Abstractsort
- Bubblesort
- Selectionsort
- Insertionsort
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort

# Differences to chriszq's work
- window is not resizable anymore
- added dots as Visualization-Type with Selection in start menu
- added classes to support dots as Visualization as  alternative to bars
- added delay-Slider
- added amount-Slider
- added .css-Stylesheet
- changed the control-panel and its logic (e.g. disable buttons when necessary)
- changed first Letter of packages/classes to upper Case (my preference)
- moved RandomCNodes.java to CNode-package and removed Util-package
- Comparison-Counter (WIP)
- ArrayAccesses-Counter (WIP)

## Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher.
